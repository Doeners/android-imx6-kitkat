Subject: [PATCH 17/68] ENGR00254700 Switch from DirectOutput to MixerOutput,
 the video pause about 2s

There is a issue in insertCommand_l() function, which is to sort
the audio command(setparameter,setvolume) by time, then thread will handle
the command in order. But sometimes the order is not correct.
